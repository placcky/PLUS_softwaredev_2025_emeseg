# **One quotation I like**
*It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop* - Confucius

# **A food or flavour that I don‘t like**
Fresh apricots! But apricot flavoured things are fine!

# **A recommendation for something and why**
I reccomend looking into the [OAV](https://www.alpenverein.at/index.php). They have lots of huts dotted around Austria on hiking routes which you can stay in for a low cost.

# **And finally, one German language word I have learned that might be useful for others to know!**
*viel Spaß* - have fun!
